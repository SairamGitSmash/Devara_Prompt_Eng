    "Step 2: Extract functional requirements from the identified features.\n",
    "Question: Based on the identified features, what are the functional requirements?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- The bot should allow users to register and select their courses.\n",
    "- It should generate personalized study paths based on user progress.\n",
    "- The bot should answer FAQs using external APIs and AI-generated responses.\n",
    "- It should retrieve learning materials from external sources.\n",
    "- The bot should allow users to set study reminders and schedules.\n",
    "- It should facilitate discussion groups and quizzes for collaborative learning.\n",

    "Question: What are the non-functional requirements for this bot?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- The bot should provide real-time responses within 2 seconds.\n",
    "- It should handle at least 500+ active users simultaneously.\n",
    "- The system should maintain 99.9% uptime.\n",
    "- User data should be encrypted for privacy and security.\n",
    "- The bot should be scalable for future enhancements.\n",
    "- The architecture should support API integrations for extended functionalities.\n",
